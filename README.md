# Nextflow Course 2024 ALBA

Reproducible research and data analysis using Nextflow

## About the course

This slow-paced hands-on course is designed for absolute beginners who want to start using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io) to achieve reproducibility of data analysis. 

### Outline

The course will train participants to build Nextflow pipelines and run them with Linux containers.

It is designed to provide trainees with short and frequent hands-on sessions while keeping theoretical sessions to a minimum.

<!--Trainees will work in a dedicated [AWS environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWS).-->
