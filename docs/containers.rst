What are containers?
---------------------

A Container can be seen as a **minimal virtual environment** that can be used in any Linux-compatible machine (and beyond).

Using containers is time- and resource-saving as they allow:

* Controlling for software installation and dependencies.
* Reproducibility of the analysis.

Containers allow us to use **exactly the same versions of the tools**.

Virtual machines or containers ?
----------------------------------

=====================================================  =====================================================
Virtualisation                                         Containerisation (aka lightweight virtualisation)
=====================================================  =====================================================
Abstraction of physical hardware                       Abstraction of application layer
Depends on hypervisor (software)                       Depends on host kernel (OS)
Do not confuse with hardware emulator                  Application and dependencies bundled all together
Enable virtual machines                                Every virtual machine with an OS (Operating System)

**Pros and cons**

===== ===================================================== =====================================================
ADV   Virtualisation                                        Containerisation
===== ===================================================== =====================================================
PROS. * Very similar to a full OS.     			     * No need of full OS installation (less space).
      * High OS diversity       			     * Better portability
      							     * Faster than virtual machines.
							     * Easier automation.
							     * Easier distribution of recipes.
							     * Better portability.


CONS. * Need more space and resources.                       * Some cases might not be exactly the same as a full OS.
      * Slower than containers.                              * Still less OS diversity, even with current solutions
      * Not that good automation.

Docker
======

What is Docker?
-------------------

* Platform for developing, shipping and running applications.
* Infrastructure as application / code.
* First version: 2013.
* Company: originally dotCloud (2010), later named Docker.
* Established `Open Container Initiative <https://www.opencontainers.org/>`__.

As a software:

* `Docker Community Edition <https://www.docker.com/products/container-runtime>`__.
* Docker Enterprise Edition.

There is an increasing number of alternative container technologies and providers. Many of them are actually based on software components originally from the Docker stack, and they normally try to address some specific use cases or weak points. As an example, **Singularity**, that we introduce later in this course, is focused on HPC environments. Another case, **Podman**, keeps a high functional compatibility with Docker but with a different focus on technology (not keeping a daemon) and permissions.


Docker components
--------------------

.. image:: http://apachebooster.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/docker-architecture.png
  :width: 700

* Read-only templates.
* Containers are run from them.
* Images are not run.
* Images have several layers.

.. image:: https://i.stack.imgur.com/vGuay.png
  :width: 700

Images versus containers
----------------------------

* **Image**: A set of layers, read-only templates, inert.
* An instance of an image is called a **container**.

When you start an image, you have a running container of this image. You can have many running containers of the same image.

*"The image is the recipe, the container is the cake; you can make as many cakes as you like with a given recipe."*

Using existing images
---------------------

Explore Docker hub
******************

Images can be stored locally or shared in a registry.


`Docker hub <https://hub.docker.com/>`__ is the main public registry for Docker images.


Let's search the keyword **ubuntu**:

.. image:: images/dockerhub_ubuntu.png
  :width: 900

docker pull: import image
*************************

* get latest image / latest release

.. code-block:: console

  docker pull ubuntu


.. image:: images/docker_pull.png
  :width: 650

* choose the version of Ubuntu you are fetching: check the different tags

.. image:: images/dockerhub_ubuntu_1804.png
  :width: 850

.. code-block:: console

  docker pull ubuntu:22.04


docker images: list images
--------------------------

.. code-block:: console

  docker images

.. image:: images/docker_images_list.png
  :width: 650

Each image has a unique **IMAGE ID**.

docker run: run image, i.e. start a container
---------------------------------------------

Now we want to use what is **inside** the image.


**docker run** creates a fresh container (active instance of the image) from a **Docker (static) image**, and runs it.


The format is:

docker run image:tag **command**

.. code-block:: console

  docker run ubuntu:22.04 /bin/ls


.. image:: images/docker_run_ls.png
  :width: 200

Now execute **ls** in your current working directory: is the result the same?


You can execute any program/command that is stored inside the image:

.. code-block:: console

  docker run ubuntu:22.04 /bin/whoami
  docker run ubuntu:22.04 cat /etc/issue


You can either execute programs in the image from the command line (see above) or **execute a container interactively**, i.e. **"enter"** the container.

With **\--name** you can provide a name to the container.

.. code-block:: console

  docker run -it ubuntu:22.04 /bin/bash

  docker run --name myubuntu -it ubuntu:22.04 /bin/bash


docker ps: check containers status
----------------------------------

List running containers:

.. code-block:: console

  docker ps


List all containers (whether they are running or not):

.. code-block:: console

  docker ps -a


docker rm, docker rmi: clean up!
--------------------------------

.. code-block:: console

  docker rm myubuntu
  docker rm -f myubuntu


.. code-block:: console

  docker rmi ubuntu:22.04


Volumes
-------

Docker containers are fully isolated. It is necessary to mount volumes in order to handle input/output files.

Syntax: **\--volume/-v** *host:container*

.. code-block:: console

  mkdir data
  # We can also copy the FASTQ we used in data
  docker run --volume $(pwd)/data:/scratch --name fastqc_container biocontainers/fastqc:v0.11.9_cv7 fastqc /scratch/B7_input_s_chr19.fastq.gz 


docker run --user
-----------------

It is possible to run certain containers with a specific user, appending ```run \--user```.

A convenient command would be:

.. code-block:: console

  docker run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) --volume $(pwd)/data:/scratch --name user_test biocontainers/fastqc:v0.11.9_cv7 touch /scratch/userfile


Build images
=============

OS commands in image building
-----------------------------

Depending on the underlying OS, there are different ways to build images.

Know your base system and their packages. Popular ones:

* `Debian <https://packages.debian.org>`__

* `CentOS <https://centos.pkgs.org/>`__

* `Alpine <https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages>`__

* Conda. `Anaconda <https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo>`__, `Conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/feedstocks/>`__, `Bioconda <https://anaconda.org/bioconda/repo>`__, etc.


Update and upgrade packages
***************************

* In **Ubuntu**:

.. code-block::

  apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y


In **CentOS**:

.. code-block::

  yum check-update && yum update -y


Search and install packages
***************************

* In **Ubuntu**:

.. code-block::

  apt search libxml2
  apt install -y libxml2-dev


* In **CentOS**:

.. code-block::

  yum search libxml2
  yum install -y libxml2-devel.x86_64


Note the **-y** option that we set for updating and for installing.<br>
It is an important option in the context of Docker: it means that you *answer yes to all questions* regarding installation.


Building recipes
----------------

All commands should be saved in a text file, named by default **Dockerfile**.

Basic instructions
******************

Each row in the recipe corresponds to a **layer** of the final image.

**FROM**: parent image. Typically, an operating system. The **base layer**.

.. code-block:: dockerfile 

  FROM ubuntu:22.04


**RUN**: the command to execute inside the image filesystem.

Think about it this way: every **RUN** line is essentially what you would run to install programs on a freshly installed Ubuntu OS.

.. code-block:: dockerfile

  RUN apt install wget


A basic recipe:

.. code-block:: dockerfile

  FROM ubuntu:22.04

  RUN apt update && apt -y upgrade
  RUN apt install -y wget


docker build
************

Implicitely looks for a **Dockerfile** file in the current directory:

.. code-block:: console

  docker build .

Same as:

.. code-block:: console

  docker build --file Dockerfile .


Syntax: **\--file / \-f**

**.** stands for the context (in this case, current directory) of the build process. This makes sense if copying files from filesystem, for instance. **IMPORTANT**: Avoid contexts (directories) overpopulated with files (even if not actually used in the recipe).

You can define a specific name for the image during the build process.

Syntax: **-t** *imagename:tag*. If not defined ```:tag``` default is latest.

.. code-block:: console

  docker build -t mytestimage-$USER .
  # Same as:
  docker build -t mytestimage-$USER:latest .


* IMPORTANT: Avoid contexts (directories) over-populated with files (even if not actually used in the recipe).
In order to avoid that some directories or files are inspected or included (e.g, with COPY command in Dockerfile), you can use .dockerignore file to specify which paths should be avoided. More information at: https://codefresh.io/docker-tutorial/not-ignore-dockerignore-2/

* NOTE: We use $USER bash env variable for avoiding conflicts between different users in the same machine. This is a common practice in HPC environments.

The last line of installation should be **Successfully built ...**: then you are good to go.

Check with ``docker images`` that you see the newly built image in the list...

Then let's check the ID of the image and run it!

.. code-block:: console

  docker images

  docker run f9f41698e2f8
  docker run mytestimage-$USER


More instructions
*****************

**WORKDIR**: all subsequent actions will be executed in that working directory

.. code-block::

  WORKDIR ~

**ADD, COPY**: add files to the image filesystem

Difference between ADD and COPY explained `here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24958140/what-is-the-difference-between-the-copy-and-add-commands-in-a-dockerfile>`__ and `here <https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/docker-tip-2-the-difference-between-copy-and-add-in-a-dockerile>`__

**COPY**: lets you copy a local file or directory from your host (the machine from which you are building the image)

**ADD**: same, but ADD works also for URLs, and for .tar archives that will be automatically extracted upon being copied.

If we have a file, let's say ```example.jpg```, we can copy it.

.. code-block::

  # COPY source destination
  COPY example.jpg .

A more sophisticated case:

.. code-block::

  FROM ubuntu:22.04

  RUN apt update && apt -y upgrade
  RUN apt install -y wget

  RUN mkdir -p /data

  WORKDIR /data

  COPY example.jpg .


**CMD, ENTRYPOINT**: command to execute when generated container starts

The ENTRYPOINT specifies a command that will always be executed when the container starts. The CMD specifies arguments that will be fed to the ENTRYPOINT

In the example below, when the container is run without an argument, it will execute `echo "hello world"`.
If it is run with the argument **hello moon** it will execute `echo "hello moon"`

.. code-block::

  FROM ubuntu:22.04
  ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/echo"]
  CMD ["hello world"]


A more complex recipe (save it in a text file named **Dockerfile**):

.. code-block::

  FROM ubuntu:22.04

  RUN mkdir -p /downloads
  WORKDIR /downloads

  RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade
  RUN apt-get install -y wget

  ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/wget"]
  CMD ["https://cdn.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/docker-swarm-hero2.png"]



.. code-block:: console

  docker run f9f41698e2f8 https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*_NQN6_YnxS29m8vFzWYlEg.png


docker tag
-----------

To tag a local image with ID "e23aaea5dff1" into the "ubuntu_wget" image name repository with version "1.0":

.. code-block:: console

  docker tag e23aaea5dff1 ubuntu_wget:1.0


More complex examples
----------------------

Check in ``containers/alba directory``


Additional docker commands
==========================

* `docker commit`: Turn a container into an image
* `docker save`: Save an image to a tar archive
* `docker load`: Load an image from a tar archive
* `docker export`: Export a container's filesystem as a tar archive (little used)
* `docker import`: Import the contents from a tarball to create a filesystem image (little used)

Recommend workflow: If necessary, commit a Docker container into an image and then save it into a tar archive that can be shared and loaded in another machine.

* Reference: https://www.baeldung.com/ops/docker-save-export

Major clean
===========

Check used space

.. code-block:: console

  docker system df


Remove unused containers (and others) - **DO WITH CARE**

.. code-block:: console

  docker system prune


Remove ALL non-running containers, images, etc. - **DO WITH MUCH MORE CARE!!!**

.. code-block:: console

  docker system prune -a

* Reference: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-remove-docker-images-containers-and-volumes


Singularity
===========

* Focus:
	* Reproducibility to scientific computing and the high-performance computing (HPC) world.
* Origin: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Later spin-off: Sylabs
* Version 1.0 (2016)
* More information: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(software) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(software)>`__

Singularity architecture

===================================================== =====================================================
Strengths                                             Weaknesses
===================================================== =====================================================
No dependency of a daemon                             At the time of writing only good support in Linux
Can be run as a simple user                           Mac experimental. Desktop edition. Only running
Avoids permission headaches and hacks                 For some features you need root account (or sudo)
Image/container is a file (or directory)
More easily portable

Two types of images: Read-only (production)
Writable (development, via sandbox)

===================================================== =====================================================

**Trivia**

Nowadays, there may be some confusion since there are two projects:

* `Apptainer <https://apptainer.org>`__
* `Sylabs Singularity <https://sylabs.io/singularity/>`__

They "forked" in 2021. So far they share most of the codebase, but eventually this could be different, and software might have different functionality.

In the command-line you can have `apptainer` installed but `singularity` is available as an alias of the former.

Container registries
--------------------

Container images, normally different versions of them, are stored in container repositories.

These repositories can be browser or discovered within, normally public, container registries.

Docker hub
**********

It is the first and most popular public container registry (which provides also private repositories).

* `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com>`__

Example:

`https://hub.docker.com/r/biocontainers/fastqc <https://hub.docker.com/r/biocontainers/fastqc>`__

.. code-block:: console

	singularity build fastqc-0.11.9_cv7.sif docker://biocontainers/fastqc:v0.11.9_cv7


Biocontainers
*************

* `Biocontainers <https://biocontainers.pro>`__

Website gathering Bioinformatics focused container images from different registries.

Originally Docker Hub was used, but now other registries are preferred.

Example: `https://biocontainers.pro/tools/fastqc <https://biocontainers.pro/tools/fastqc>`__

**Via quay.io**

`https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/fastqc <https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/fastqc>`__

.. code-block:: console

	singularity build fastqc-0.11.9.sif docker://quay.io/biocontainers/fastqc:0.11.9--0


**Via Galaxy project prebuilt images**

.. code-block:: console

	singularity pull --name fastqc-0.11.9.sif https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/fastqc:0.11.9--0


Galaxy project provides all Bioinformatics software from the BioContainers initiative as Singularity prebuilt images. If download and conversion time of images is an issue, this might be the best option for those working in the biomedical field.

Link: https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/


**From Docker daemon**

If you have a Docker daemon running in your machine, you can also build images from there without need to share them in a registry first.

.. code-block:: console

	singularity build myubuntu.sif docker-daemon://myubuntu:latest

**From a Docker tar archive**

If you saved a tar archive from a Docker image, you can also build images from there. This is useful if you might not have a Docker daemon running in the machine you intend to use Singularity.
This is common in HPC environments.

.. code-block:: console

  # Where you have a Docker daemon running
	docker save -o myubuntu.tar myubuntu:latest
  # Where you have Singularity
  singularity build myubuntu.sif docker-archive://myubuntu.tar


Running and executing containers
--------------------------------

Once we have some image files (or directories) ready, we can run processes.

Singularity shell
*****************

The straight-forward exploratory approach is equivalent to ``docker run -ti biocontainers/fastqc:v0.11.9_cv7 /bin/sh`` but with a more handy syntax.

.. code-block:: console

	singularity shell fastqc-0.11.9.sif


Move around the directories and notice how the isolation approach is different in comparison to Docker. You can access most of the host filesystem.

Singularity exec
****************

That is the most common way to execute Singularity (equivalent to ``docker exec``). That would be the normal approach in an HPC environment.

.. code-block:: console

    singularity exec fastqc-0.11.9.sif fastqc

a processing of a FASTQ file from *data* directory:

.. code-block:: console

    singularity exec fastqc-0.11.9_cv7.sif fastqc B7_input_s_chr19.fastq.gz

Environment control
*******************

By default, Singularity inherits a profile environment (e.g., PATH environment variable). This may be convenient in some circumstances, but it can also lead to unexpected problems when your own environment clashes with the default one from the image.

.. code-block:: console

    singularity shell -e fastqc-0.11.9.sif
    singularity exec -e fastqc-0.11.9.sif fastqc

Compare ``env`` command with and without -e modifier.

.. code-block:: console

    singularity exec fastqc-0.11.9.sif env
    singularity exec -e fastqc-0.11.9.sif env

Exercise
********

Using the 2 fastq available files, process them using fastqc.

.. raw:: html

   <details>
   <summary><a>Suggested solution</a></summary>


.. code-block:: console

	# Let's create a dummy directory
	mkdir data

	# Let's copy contents FASTQC files in data directory

	singularity exec fastqc.sif fastqc data/*fastq.gz

	# Check you have some HTMLs there. Remove them
	rm data/*html

	# Let's use shell
	singularity shell fastqc.sif
	> cd data
	> fastqc *fastq.gz
	> exit

.. raw:: html

  </details>



Singularity tips
----------------

Troubleshooting
***************

.. code-block:: console

     singularity --help

Fakeroot
********

Singularity permissions are an evolving field. If you don't have access to ``sudo``, it might be worth considering using **--fakeroot/-f** parameter.

* More details at `https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/fakeroot.html <https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/fakeroot.html>`__

Singularity cache directory
***************************

.. code-block::

    $HOME/.singularity

* It stores cached images from registries, instances, etc.
* If problems may be a good place to clean. When running ``sudo``, $HOME is /root.

Global singularity configuration
********************************

Normally at ``/etc/singularity/singularity.conf`` or similar (e.g., preceded by ``/usr/local/``)

* It can only be modified by users with administration permissions
* Worth noting ``bind path`` lines, which point default mounted directories in containers
