Using Singularity
=======================

We recommend using Singularity instead of Docker in HPC environments.
This can be done using the Nextflow parameter `-with-singularity` without changing the code.

Nextflow will take care of **pulling, converting, and storing the image** for you. This will be done only once and then Nextflow will use the stored image for further executions.

Within an AWS main node, both Docker and Singularity are available. While within the AWS batch system, only Docker is available.


.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run test2.nf -with-singularity -bg > log

	tail -f log

Let's inspect the folder `singularity`:

.. code-block:: console

	ls singularity/
	biocorecrg-c4lwg-2018-latest.img


This singularity image can be used to execute the code outside the pipeline **exactly the same way** as inside the pipeline.

Sometimes we can be interested in launching only a specific job, because it might fail or for making a test. For that, we can go to the corresponding temporary folder; for example, one of the fastQC temporary folders:

.. code-block:: console

	cd work/da/eb7564*/


Inspecting the `.command.run` file shows us this piece of code:

.. code-block:: groovy

	...

	nxf_launch() {
	    set +u; env - PATH="$PATH" SINGULARITYENV_TMP="$TMP" SINGULARITYENV_TMPDIR="$TMPDIR" singularity exec /home/ec2-user/git/CoursesCRG_Containers_Nextflow_May_2021/nextflow/test2/singularity/biocorecrg-c4lwg-2018-latest.img /bin/bash -c "cd $PWD; /bin/bash -ue /home/ec2-user/git/CoursesCRG_Containers_Nextflow_May_2021/nextflow/test2/work/da/eb756433aa0881d25b20afb5b1366e/.command.sh"
	}
	...


This means that Nextflow is running the code by using the **singularity exec** command.

Thus we can launch this command outside the pipeline (locally):

.. code-block:: console

	bash .command.run

	...

If you have to submit a job to a HPC you need to use the corresponding program, such as **qsub** if you have a Sun Grid Engine or **sbatch** if you have Slurm. Here an example using Slurm:

.. code-block:: console

	sbatch .command.run


Profiles
=================

For deploying a pipeline in a cluster or Cloud, in the **nextflow.config** file, we need to indicate what kind of the `executor <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#executor>`__ to use.

In the Nextflow framework architecture, the executor indicates which **batch-queue system** to use to submit jobs to an HPC or to Cloud.

The executor is completely abstracted, so you can switch from SGE to SLURM just by changing this parameter in the configuration file.

You can group different classes of configuration or **profiles** within a single **nextflow.config** file.

Let's inspect the **nextflow.config** file in **test3** folder. We can see three different profiles:

- standard
- cluster
- cloud

The first profile indicates the resources needed for running the pipeline locally. They are quite small since we have little power and CPU on the test node.


.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/nextflow.config
   :language: groovy
   :lines: 1-21


As you can see, we explicitly indicated the **local** executor. By definition, the local executor is a default executor if the pipeline is run without specifying a profile.

The second profile is for running the pipeline on the **cluster**; here in particular for the cluster supporting the Sun Grid Engine queuing system:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/nextflow.config
   :language: groovy
   :lines: 22-38


This profile indicates that the system uses **Sun Grid Engine** as a job scheduler and that we have different queues for small jobs and more intensive ones.

Deployment in the AWS cloud
=============================

The final profile is for running the pipeline in the **Amazon Cloud**, known as Amazon Web Services or AWS. In particular, we will use **AWS Batch** that allows the execution of containerized workloads in the Amazon cloud infrastructure (where NNNN is the number of your bucket which you can see in the mounted folder `/mnt` by typing the command **df**).

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/nextflow.config
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 40-57


We indicate the **AWS specific parameters** (**region** and **cliPath**) and the executor **awsbatch**.
Then we indicate the working directory, which should be mounted as `S3 volume <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`__.
This is mandatory when running Nextflow on the cloud.

We can now launch the pipeline indicating `-profile cloud`:

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run test3.nf -bg -with-docker -profile cloud > log


Note that there is no longer a **work** folder in the directory where test3.nf is located, because, in the AWS cloud, the output is copied locally in the folder **/mnt/nf-class-bucket-NNN/work** (you can see the mounted folder - and the corresponding number - typing **df**).

The multiqc report can be seen on the AWS webpage at https://nf-class-bucket-NNN.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/results/ouptut_multiQC/multiqc_report.html

But you need before to change permissions for that file (where NNNN is the number of your bucket):

.. code-block:: console

	chmod 775 /mnt/nf-class-bucket-NNNN/results/ouptut_multiQCmultiqc_report.html


Sometimes you can find that the Nextflow process itself is very memory intensive and the main node can run out of memory. To avoid this, you can reduce the memory needed by setting an environmental variable:

.. code-block:: console

	export NXF_OPTS="-Xms50m -Xmx500m"


Again we can copy the output file to the bucket.

We can also tell Nextflow to directly copy the output file to the S3 bucket: to do so, change the parameter **outdir** in the params file (use the bucket corresponding to your AWS instance):

.. code-block:: groovy

	outdir = "s3://nf-class-bucket-NNNN/results"


Making a Nextflow pipeline for image processing
======================

We can build a pipeline incrementally adding more and more processes.
Nextflow will handle the dependencies between the input/output and the parallelization.

Let's see the content of the folder **nextflow/ex_alba**

.. code-block:: console

	ls
	etl_peem.py  importUview_v3.py  step1_denoise.py  step2_normalize.py  step3_aggregate_and_save.py

We have some Python scripts made by Fern√°n and Nicolas for making those steps:

- **step1_denoise.py**: it will read an image file (".dat"), turn it into a NumPy array ("_den.npy"), and denoise it.

.. code-block:: console

	# command line
	./step1_denoise.py my_image.dat
	# output my_image_den.npy


- **step2_normalize.py**: it will read a denoised NumPy array ("_den.npy"), that is output by the previous step and produces a nomalized / denoised NumPy array ("_den_norm.npy"). It needs the original image file in the current directory for working even if not specified in the command line. 

.. code-block:: console

	ls ./
	step2_normalize.py my_image_den.npy my_image.dat
	# command line
	./step2_normalize.py my_image_den.npy
	# output my_image_den_norm.npy


- **step3_aggregate_and_save.py**: it will read all the normalized/denoised NumPy arrays together and it will produce a NeXus/HDF5 file called **example.nxs**




EXERCISE
============

Make the pipeline considering the use of the docker/singularity image **biocorecrg/alba:0.1** hosted at dockerhub. The images are at **../../testdata/test_images/** and the executor must be specified for working with our infrastructure.
